#  Analyze CVE-2021-43617

As quoted verbatim from NVD (a website specialized in analyzing and synthesizing CVEs), CVE-2021-43617:
> Laravel Framework through 8.70.2 does not sufficiently block the upload of executable PHP content because Illuminate/Validation/Concerns/ValidatesAttributes.php lacks a check for .phar files, which are handled as application/x-httpd-php on systems based on Debian. 

*(NOTE: this CVE Record is for Laravel Framework, and is unrelated to any reports concerning incorrectly written user applications for image upload.)*

## CVE Analysis

### Cause

By default, the `PHP-apache` config file will configure the execution of "/x-httpd-php" applications when users upload files with the extensions ".php, .phar, .phtml".

On the other hand, Laravel's image upload handler at "Illuminate/Validation/Concerns/ValidatesAttributes.php " performs validation skipping uploading files ending in ".phar".

So if users combine the use of Laravel framework with a php apache (apache server) will be the official cause for this vulnerability to occur.

### Patches

On 11/16/20 Laravel released a patch at Laravel 8.77.10 to prevent uploading of ".phar" files.
